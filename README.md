# CETA (Corporate Entity Tracking Automation)
CETA is an ongoing research project at the University of Central Florida (UCF) focused on analyzing and understanding global corporate entities through a large historical dataset. This dataset includes information on corporations worldwide, with records dating as far back as 1930. The primary objectives of this research include tracking foreign ownership, influence, illegal activities, and most importantly, making temporal predictions regarding the longevity of companies based on their attributes.

## Project Overview
The cornerstone of my contribution to this research is the development of a custom RandomForestRegressor model. This model is designed to perform temporal predictions on how long a company is likely to last, given its specific attributes. However, the model's capabilities extend beyond just temporal predictions, as I continue to fine-tune and enhance its accuracy and functionality.

### Tools and Technologies Used
-  **RandomForestRegressor**: A machine learning model used for making predictions based on historical data.
-  **NetworkX**: For creating and analyzing graphs of corporate entities, relationships, and influences.
-  **Pandas**: Essential for data manipulation and analysis.
-  **scikit-learn**: Used for building and optimizing the RandomForestRegressor model.
-  **GraphML**: For handling graph data in a structured format.
-  **NumPy**: Utilized for efficient numerical operations.
## Key Research Focus
-  **Temporal Predictions**: Predicting the lifespan of a company based on a variety of attributes, including ownership, financial performance, and historical data.
-  **Foreign Ownership and Influence**: Understanding how foreign entities impact corporate structures and decision-making.
-  **Illegal Activities**: Identifying patterns and trends that may indicate illegal operations within corporations.
## Model Development
The RandomForestRegressor model was entirely developed by me as part of my contribution to this research project. I have been iteratively refining the model to improve its predictive accuracy and to expand its utility beyond just temporal predictions. This ongoing process includes feature engineering, model tuning, and validation using various statistical and machine learning techniques.
